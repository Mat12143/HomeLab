# Overview

## Hardware

I am currently running a `Laptop with an Intel i5-8250U, 8GB of Ram, 500GB HDD`

**Is it the best solution?**
For my present use case it is more than enough computing power for what I am currently running. Power consumption, also, is very important for me, so going with a power hungry old desktop pc, was a no go, especially when I had a "Old" Laptop laying around taking dust

## ðŸ“¦ Services

I am currently running a few Docker Containers. All the configurations are in the [compose.yml](https://github.com/Mat12143/HomeLab/blob/main/compose.yaml)

## [Homepage](https://github.com/gethomepage/homepage)

A simple and minimal homepage with some information about the hardware status and containers health, with some cool services stats

Network-wide AD Blocking services through DNS
